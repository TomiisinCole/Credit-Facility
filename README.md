## Loan-Default-Risk-Model

Predicting the chances of delinquency on a loan or line of credit in order to help them decide whether or not to give out a loan to a person

I decided to learn extensively about data preprocessing and the impact of that on different algorithms. The code is well explained and I tried out various comparisons between different classifier algorithms on a preprocessed data set and an un-preprocessed one. I realized that some algorithms perform better on preprocessed data sets while others do not.

This afforded me the opportunity to really understand the essence of preprocessing on various algorithms and the inner workings of these algorithms. I also improved my EDA and feature engineering skills.

Used the Smote algorithm to handle the Imbalance in the data.
